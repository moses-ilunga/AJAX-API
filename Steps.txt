PART 1: Building the Form

-> Start by building a simple form with an input for a search term and a submit button.
	+ When the user submits the form, use axios to make a request to GIPHY for information based on that term.
	+ After receiving the response, console.log the response data to make sure you’re getting back what you expect.
	
PART 2: Appending GIFs

-> Instead of logging it (console.logging the data), grab a GIF from the response data and append the GIF to the page. 
	+ Ensure that if you submit the form multiple times, you’ll get multiple GIFs showing up.

PART 3: Removing GIFs

-> Add a button next to the form which, when clicked, will remove all GIFs from the page.
